            <h1>FoodSaver's Mission</h1>
            <p>In the US, a lot of food is wasted annually in homes. A LOT of food. While globally, about 1.4 billion tons of food is wasted each year, the US contributes about 40 million tons, (that's 80 billion pounds!). Of that 40 million tons, 43% of it comes from US homes. It's difficult for people to effectively utilize all the food they have in their kitchen before it goes to waste. That's why FoodSaver was created.</p>
            <p>FoodSaver was created as a means to mitigate food waste in household kitchens. By combining the shelf life of food with popular recipes into one application, users are able to find recipes quickly based on what's expiring soon in their kitchen. This will not only help mitigate food waste, but it will also save the user money on trips to the grocery store.</p>
            <p>This app has a lot of unique features. A user can add foods to their kitchen, add and edit recipes, and find recipes based on what they have available to them. There are still many features that will be implemented in the future so be on the lookout for future updates</p>
